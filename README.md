# Supervised Learning Challenge
Module 20 Challenge: Supervised learning of credit risk classification data.

Graded 95/100


## Report:
	This project applied machine learning to identify loan risk given a pre-generated data set of loan data including loan and borrower information.
	The purpose of the analsysis was to predict the risk of future loans given historical data.

### Results:
- Machine Learning Model 1:
	Model 1 applied logistic regression on the dataset to predict a healthy vs high-risk loan with an accuracy of 99.2%.
		Precision for a healthy loan was 1.00 and for high-risk loan was 0.85.
		Accuracy for a healthy loan was 0.99 and for high-risk loan was 0.99 (both weighted values)

- Machine Learning Model 2:
	Model 2 applied Logistic Regression with the "RandomOverSampler" module to predict a healthy vs high-risk loan with an accuracy of 99.2%
		Precision for a healthy loan was 1.00 and for high-risk loan was 0.85
		Accuracy for a healthy loan was 0.99 and for high-risk loan was 0.99 (both weighted values)



### Summary:
	Both machine learning models resulted in similar prediction performance. Either method will produce accurate and precise results- whether or not the data was oversampled.
