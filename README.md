# Supervised Learning Challenge
Module 20 Challenge: Supervised learning of credit risk classification data.

Graded __/100


## Report:
	This project applied machine learning to identify loan risk given a pre-generated data set of loan data including loan and borrower information.
	The purpose of the analsysis was to predict the risk of future loans given historical data.

### Results:
- Machine Learning Model 1:
	Model 1 applied logistic regression on the dataset to predict a healthy vs high-risk loan with an accuracy of 99.2%.
		Precision for a healthy loan was 1.00 and for high-risk loan was 0.85.
		Accuracy for a healthy loan was 0.99 and for high-risk loan was 0.99 (both weighted values)

- Machine Learning Model 2:
	Model 2 applied Logistic Regression with the "RandomOverSampler" module to predict a healthy vs high-risk loan with an accuracy of XXXXX
		Precision for a healthy loan was XXX and for high-risk loan was XXXX.
		Accuracy for a healthy loan was XXX and for high-risk loan was XXX (both weighted values)



### Summary:

"
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
